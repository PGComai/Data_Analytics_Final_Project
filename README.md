    2. Description of the data
    3. questions that the team plans to answer with the project 

    Data Cleaning Process: 
    Created tables using PostgresSQL in pgAdmin and imported the data of three csv files into the the approriate table. Combiend all three tables into the book_crossing_dataset table using left joins. Exported the table as a csv file called book_crossing_data. Opened the file in Jupyter Notebook to remove null values, ages over the age of 85, and ages under 10.
