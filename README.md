# Data_Analytics_Final_Project

Original Dataset Link: 
Our group is using the Book Crossing data set available on the [Institut for Informatic Freiburg](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) website.  

Data Cleaning Process: Created tables using PostgresSQL in pgAdmin and imported the data of three csv files into the the approriate table. Combiend all three tables into the book_crossing_dataset table using left joins. Exported the table as a csv file called book_crossing_data. Opened the file in Jupyter Notebook to remove null values and remove and ages over the age of 50.
